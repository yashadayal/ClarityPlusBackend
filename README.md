# ClarityPlusPackage
Problem Statement

The existing package management procedure within IIITB involves the delivery of shipments intended for students and professors to the reception area. At this point, an on-duty guard is tasked with manually recording the recipient's details in a register. Subsequently, upon receiving a courier, the designated recipient is required to provide their signature in the register, acknowledging the successful receipt of the package.

However, this seemingly straightforward process is marred by two fundamental challenges that significantly impact its efficiency and security:

    Authenticity of the Recipient: The primary challenge revolves around the authenticity of the recipient. The inherent risk of individuals falsifying signatures to claim packages not intended for them introduces a critical security vulnerability.

    Environmental Impact: Moreover, the second challenge pertains to the environmentally unsustainable consumption of paper resources due to the manual register-based documentation.

Addressing these issues is of paramount importance to ensure a seamless and secure package handling process within the college campus. The introduction of the "Clarity Plus Package" micro-services application marks a transformative step towards resolving these challenges effectively. By adopting this innovative platform, IIITB seeks to establish an advanced, secure, and eco-friendly approach to package management, ushering in an era of enhanced operational efficiency and reduced environmental impact.
